WBP Machine Learning Applications (Chapter 4) - 
This repository contains the data and a markdown file with the complete tidymodels workflow used for the machine learning applications in Chapter 4 of the study.

Repository Structure - 
Data: Contains the processed whole-body plethysmography (WBP) respiratory data from mice used in the analysis. This data is integral to the machine learning workflow.

Markdown File: The markdown file documents the full tidymodels workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and feature importance extraction across seven machine learning models. This file provides reproducible code and analysis steps.

Contents - 
Processed WBP respiratory data (in .xls format)
tidymodels_wbp_pipeline_infection_predict.Rmd
Markdown file containing the tidymodels workflow and associated code used to compare the performance of seven machine learning models on WBP data from mice to predict infection status.

Instructions - 
Clone or download the repository.
Install the required packages listed in the markdown file, primarily tidymodels and its dependencies.
Run the chapter4_wbp_ml_analysis.Rmd file to reproduce the analysis, visualize results, and explore the performance metrics of each machine learning model.

For full package details and installation instructions, please refer to the markdown file.

This README file provides an overview of the repository's structure, its contents, and how to run the analysis.
